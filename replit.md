# Football Prediction System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive football match prediction system built with Streamlit that uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes. The system combines multiple data sources, sophisticated feature engineering, and ensemble modeling to provide accurate predictions with confidence metrics.

The application is structured as a multi-page Streamlit app that allows users to make predictions, train models, collect data, analyze performance, and gain insights into model behavior.
